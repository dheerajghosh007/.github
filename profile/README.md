## About Me
I've completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Bhilai Institute of Technology, Durg. 

I've vast experience in Community and event management with both online and offline work along with volunteering to industrial experience (You can check my experience section on LinkedIn below).
I always try to give back something to the community and vice versa.
I am always ready to have new experiences, meet new people, and learn new things.

Please get in touch if you share my interests or have potential job or collaboration opportunities.
